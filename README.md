In this project, I have created a feedforward neural network from scratch and used it to classify a given paragraph among three topics.
I have used text processing techniques (such as removing stopwards, creating ngrams) to preprocess the textual data before feeding it to my model.
Finally I have measured the performance metrics such as recall, precision, F1-score.
